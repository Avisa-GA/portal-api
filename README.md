## React: Working with APIs

While React simplifies the challenge of making API calls, figuring out how best to structure the application around an API is more difficult.

How to connect to APIs using axios, which simplifies API calls by automatically transforming JSON data. 

* Setting up the React project
* Fetching data
* Updating your state
* Using the axios library to make HTTP requests
